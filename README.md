# Education-Website ( Universal Classroom Web App )

This is a project I created to teach me all the different types of services needed to create & launch a web application with features.

I worked with a fellow programmer (Kyle) to build and deploy the website. You can find his Github here - https://github.com/kyle123c

The app (located here - https://devaaron7.github.io/Education-Website/) allows for basic file sharing between two users ( Teacher & Student).

Current Features:
- Account creation ( new users are setup as Student by default)
- Login ( With session verification logic )

Teachers:
- Assign work to students ( PDF file upload, title & description input fields)
- Download completed work from Student user
- Provide Grade & additional feedback thats sent to the student's page.

Students:
- Download work assigned by Teacher user
- Upload completed work and send back to Teacher user

Please feel free to walk through the website and test the features out.

- Using free website hosting solutions like Github for the frontend & Heroku for the backend services
- Implementing API services such as Dropbox to allow uploading & downloading features on the website

Future Plans:
- Add more user profile features (bio, photo, etc)
- Ability to assign different work to different students
- Chat window / messaging center
- Ability to export out grades/ feedback into an excel file
- Better security to match industry standards
