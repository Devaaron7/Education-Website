# Education-Website ( Universal Classroom Web App )

This is a project I created to teach me all the different types of services needed to create & launch a web application with features.

The app (located here - https://devaaron7.github.io/Education-Website/) allows for basic file sharing between two users ( Teacher & Student).

Current Features:
- Account creation ( new users are setup as Student by default)
- Login ( With session verification logic )

Teachers:
- Assign work to students ( PDF file upload, title & description input fields)
- Download completed work from Student user
- Provide Grade & additional feedback that sent to the student's page.

Students:
- Download work assigned by Teacher user
- Upload completed work and send back to Teacher user

Please feel free to walk through the website and test the features out.

Teacher login:
email="teacher@gmail.com"
password="123"

Student login:
email="student@gmail.com"
password="123"
